```yml
name: Security check - Bandit

on: push

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ ubuntu-latest, macos-latest ]
    name: Python ${{ matrix.os }} 

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Security check - Bandit
      uses: ./
      with:
        python_version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
        project_path: .
        ignore_failure: true

    - name: Security check report artifacts
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v1
      # if: failure()
      with:
        name: Security report
        path: output/security_report.txt
```


### Getting Started :airplane:

You can include the action in your workflow to trigger on any event that
 [GitHub actions supports](https://help.github.com/en/articles/events-that-trigger-workflows). 
 If the remote branch that you wish to deploy to doesn't already exist the action will create it for you. 
 Your workflow will also need to include the `actions/checkout` step before this workflow runs 
 in order for the deployment to work.


If you'd like to make it so the workflow only triggers on push events
 to specific branches then you can modify the `on` section.

```yml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
```

### Configuration 📁

The `with` portion of the workflow **must** be configured before the action will work.
 You can add these in the `with` section found in the examples above. 
 Any `secrets` must be referenced using the bracket syntax and stored 
 in the GitHub repositories `Settings/Secrets` menu. 
 You can learn more about setting environment variables 
 with GitHub actions [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsenv).

#### Required Setup

One of the following deployment options must be configured.

| Key                | Value Information                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Type   | Required | Default |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | -------- | -------- |
| `PROJECT_PATH` | To provide you python location at which this security check needed to be done.                                                                                                 | `with` | **No**  | "." |
| `IGNORE_FAILURE` | This is to ignore the security failures and pass the check.                                                                                                 | `with` | **No**  | false |
