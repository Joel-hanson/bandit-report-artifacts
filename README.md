        python-version: [ '2.7.17', '3.6.10' ]
    name: Python ${{ matrix.python-version }} ${{ matrix.os }} 

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Python security check using Bandit
      uses: Joel-hanson/bandit-report-artifacts@V1
      with:
        python_version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
        project_path: .
        ignore_failure: true

    - name: Security check report artifacts
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v1

        path: output/security_report.txt
```


### Getting Started :airplane:

You can include the action in your workflow to trigger on any event that [GitHub actions supports](https://help.github.com/en/articles/events-that-trigger-workflows). If the remote branch that you wish to deploy to doesn't already exist the action will create it for you. Your workflow will also need to include the `actions/checkout` step before this workflow runs in order for the deployment to work.


If you'd like to make it so the workflow only triggers on push events to specific branches then you can modify the `on` section.

```yml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
```

### Configuration üìÅ

The `with` portion of the workflow **must** be configured before the action will work. You can add these in the `with` section found in the examples above. Any `secrets` must be referenced using the bracket syntax and stored in the GitHub repositories `Settings/Secrets` menu. You can learn more about setting environment variables with GitHub actions [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsenv).

#### Required Setup

One of the following deployment options must be configured.

| Key                | Value Information                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Type   | Required | Default |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | -------- | -------- |
| `PYTHON_VERSION`          | You should provide your python version.'                                                                                                                           | `with`           | **Yes**  | 3.6.10 |
| `PROJECT_PATH` | To provide you python location at which this security check needed to be done.                                                                                                 | `with` | **No**  | "." |
| `IGNORE_FAILURE` | This is to ignore the security failures and pass the check.                                                                                                 | `with` | **No**  | false |
